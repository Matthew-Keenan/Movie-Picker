# Movie-Picker
The main reason for this project was that my roommates and I were watching a lot of movies, but could never decide on one. 
Making this program helped to solve this by letting it choose for us.

The program operates assuming that the user has set up the two text files it needs ahead of time. The two text files are Watched.txt and Unwatched.txt. 

The main function of the program is to pick a movie. If the user indicates that they want a movie to be picked, they will be asked if they want it to be chosen fully at 
random, randomly picked with a maximum time length, or randomly picked from a specified genre.

The user can add movies to either text file, inputing a movie title, length (in minutes), and genre before specifying which
text file the program should write it to. 

The program can also read through and print the full list of unwatched movies to get an idea of the options available to them. 

Making this program not only help pick a movie without argument, but helped me maintain different skills and concepts of python and programming in general. It 
provided us a service but was also an enjoyable project for me to do in my free time.
